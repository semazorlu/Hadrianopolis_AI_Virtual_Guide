### 📖 Executive Summary
This project is a **next-generation digital tourism assistant** developed for the Ancient City of Hadrianopolis. Unlike traditional audio guides, this system utilizes **Generative AI (LLM)** to allow visitors to have a "conversation" with history.

Visitors scan **QR codes** placed on artifacts and can ask specific questions like *"Who built this structure?"* or *"What was this room used for?"* receiving instant, historically accurate, and dynamic responses.
